## Dice-o-metric

This is a game for the [Simplicity Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/simplicity-jam-1), the theme of which is "Roll the dice". Dice-o-metric is a sort of combination slide puzzle / matching game with an isometric board view:

The goal is to remove all dice from the board, which is done by "bumping" at least 2 dice of the same kind together. All neighboring dice with this same number will be removed as well. If you get a to point where there are no legal moves left, that's game over. "Rock" dice cannot be moved or matched.

I made this game in my spare time over the course of 10 days, and thoroughly enjoyed it!
